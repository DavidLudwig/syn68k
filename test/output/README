This is the output from running syngentest with various command line options
on two different platforms.

One platform was a hardware 68k (probably a 68040 running NEXTSTEP,
but it's been so long that I don't remember), done sometime in the mid
1990s.  IIRC, the command line options were

  ../syngentest 1000 > 68k.1000
  ../syngentest -noncc 1000 > 68k.noncc.1000
  ../syngentest 100 > dump-68k-100-cc
  ../syngentest -noncc 100 > dump-68k-100-noncc

The other platform is an i686 Fedora 9 system and those command line switches
were:

  ../syngentest > syngentest
  ../syngentest -noncc > syngentest-noncc
  ../syngentest -noncc -notnative > syngentest-noncc-notnative
  ../syngentest -notnative > syngentest-notnative

Unfortunately, the memory location that we used to use to test on the 68k
is unavailable on modern Linux systems, so we can't actually compare the
old output from a real 680x0 to the new output, but the new output is
presumably correct, since we did a lot of testing with a real 68k a long time
ago and Executor runs with the libsyn68k used with this Fedora 9 syn68k.

The output when you include "-noncc" *should* be different from when
you don't include it (you can see the difference between 68k.1000 and
68k.noncc.1000.  The output when you include "-notnative" "shouldn't"
be different, but it is, and that may well be a bug in Syn68k,
although it's a bug that has (IIRC) been there from day one.  The
problem is that we get a different set of condition codes for divs_reg
in a particular case.
