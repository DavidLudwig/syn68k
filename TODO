        --enable-native should default to true IFF on i386

        x86_64 (non-native) doesn't run

                try to get non-native i386 running first

                look at how we convert between Mac addresses and pointers
                (especially look at code we used to use on alpha)

        Mac OS X fixes:

                figure out why i486-cleanup.pl basically eats all
                of syn68k.s

	Make so we can build the various debug versions, non-native, etc.

	Figure out exactly which variables Makefile.common.in sets, then
	get rid of Makefile.common.in

		see TODO.variables

		figure out what to do concerning bswap

	Look into what else from syn68k we can delete

		Makefile.common.in

		config

	Make sure make clean really does a make clean

	Make sure we get proper dependencies (if possible)

	make sure syn68k builds on a powerpc (either the
	old yellow dog linux on sybil, or on Mac OS X on sybil)

		non-native

	figure out *exactly* which options should be available
	via configure

	write-up what is needed to do testing on a real m68k

	need a .spec file so we can build syn68k and syn68k-devel
	RPMS
