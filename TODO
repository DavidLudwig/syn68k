        See if we can find an address to map that is available to all our
        currently tested targets (i386-native, i386-notnative, x86_64,
        ppc)

	Make so we can build the various debug versions, non-native, etc.

        	figure out *exactly* which options should be available
        	via configure

        Not sure what we should do with x86_64 machines; need to know more
        about what the popular distributions do

	Figure out exactly which variables Makefile.common.in sets, then
	get rid of Makefile.common.in

		see TODO.variables

		figure out what to do concerning bswap

	Look into what else from syn68k we can delete

		Makefile.common.in

		config

	Make sure make clean really does a make clean

	Make sure we get proper dependencies (if possible)

	write-up what is needed to do testing on a real m68k

	need a .spec file so we can build syn68k and syn68k-devel
	RPMS

        May be able to avoid dce problems if we use && for labels (that
        may also get rid of our need for the cleanup code, too)
