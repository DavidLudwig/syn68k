	Make it so that we can install libsyn68k.a and the .h files

	Make so we can build the various debug versions, non-native, etc.

	Figure out exactly which variables Makefile.common.in sets, then
	get rid of Makefile.common.in

		see TODO.variables

		figure out what to do concerning bswap

	Look into what else from syn68k we can delete

		Makefile.common.in

		config

	Make sure make clean really does a make clean

	Make sure we get proper dependencies (if possible)

	make sure syn68k builds on a powerpc (either the
	old yellow dog linux on sybil, or on Mac OS X on sybil)

		non-native

	figure out *exactly* which options should be available
	via configure

	clean the junk out of test (mostly old test results)

	build some semi-canonical test results to use for
	comparing on other platforms

	write-up what is needed to do testing on a real m68k

	need a .spec file so we can build syn68k and syn68k-devel
