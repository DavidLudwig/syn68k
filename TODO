        --enable-native should only be present where it's available
        and perhaps should default to whatever is fastest (e.g., I
        believe it's faster to run native in 32-bit mode on an x86_64
        than it is to run non-native in 64-bit mode on an x86_64, although
        I haven't yet timed them)

        only invoke the x86 cleanup & optimize when compiling for an
        x86 architecture

        Fix i486-cleanup.pl and i486-optimize.pl for all x86 targets
        (including Mac OS X)

        See if we can find an address to map that is available to all our
        currently tested targets (i386-native, i386-notnative, x86_64,
        ppc)

	Make so we can build the various debug versions, non-native, etc.

        	figure out *exactly* which options should be available
        	via configure

	Figure out exactly which variables Makefile.common.in sets, then
	get rid of Makefile.common.in

		see TODO.variables

		figure out what to do concerning bswap

	Look into what else from syn68k we can delete

		Makefile.common.in

		config

	Make sure make clean really does a make clean

	Make sure we get proper dependencies (if possible)

	write-up what is needed to do testing on a real m68k

	need a .spec file so we can build syn68k and syn68k-devel
	RPMS
