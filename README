Syn68k has not been actively worked on since about 1995.  A few mods
have been made here and there to keep up with changes in gcc.

My email address is still <ctm@ardi.com>, although ARDI itself is
defunct.  I get a ridiculous amount of spam and will quite possibly
not see email addressed to me.

For a few years I've been meaning to verify that the code builds,
write a little documentation, explain a little history, maybe even set
up a mailing list for people, etc... but other things have always
taken precedence.

I have just made some mods so that Syn68k will compile on a Fedora 9
i386 system (gcc 4.3.0-8).  Unfortunately the resultant libsyn68k.a
does not work with Executor.

If I build gcc 4.1.2 from scratch and use that to compile syn68k.  I
can then use Executor (whether it's built using 4.1.2 or 4.3.0).  It
also works with a stock gcc 4.2.4.

A stock 4.3.3 fails, so most likely something was changed in 4.3 that
causes problems.  Most likely a combination of looking at the
documentation (what's changed, what new command line switches) and
playing with .o files will be sufficient to allow me to find a fix.

To compile syn68k, try

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  make install

or if you want to use a non-standard gcc, try something like (assumes
you've built gcc 4.2.4 configured with --prefix=/usr/gcc424):

  ./autogen.sh
  CC=/usr/gcc424/bin/gcc CC_FOR_BUILD=/usr/gcc424/bin/gcc ./configure
  make
  make install
