Syn68k has not been actively worked on since about 1995.  A few
mods have been made here and there to keep up with changes in gcc.

My email address is still <ctm@ardi.com>, although ARDI itself is
defunct.  I get a ridiculous amount of spam and will quite possibly
not see email addressed to me.

For a few years I've been meaning to verify that the code builds,
write a little documentation, explain a little history, maybe even
set up a mailing list for people, etc... but other things have always
taken precedence.

I have just made some mods so that Syn68k will compile on a Fedora 9
i386 system.  I haven't yet tested it against anywhere else, nor have
I verified that what is created will actually work with Executor.

To compile it, try

  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
