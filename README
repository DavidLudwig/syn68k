Syn68k has not been actively worked on for about thirteen years.  A few
mods have been made here and there to keep up with changes in gcc.

Right now I'm putting it on github (with Mat Hostetter's permission)
as-is.  I haven't even tried building it in the last year or so.

My email address is still <ctm@ardi.com>, although ARDI itself is
defunct.  I get a ridiculous amount of spam and will quite possibly
not see email addressed to me.

For a few years I've been meaning to verify that the code builds,
write a little documentation, explain a little history, maybe even
set up a mailing list for people, etc... but other things have always
taken precedence.

Executor will be put on github soon.
