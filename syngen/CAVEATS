1) CC bits may not be valid during an interrupt
2) We don't support supervisor mode properly
	a) We have only one SP (no MSP, ISP, USP)
	b) You cannot leave supervisor mode
3) The interrupt stack space is in a static array which may not look
   like a valid address from the Mac's point of view.
4) Interrupt/trap handlers we write are responsible for performing their
   own RTE.
5) Flushing the cache during an interrupt can have bad effects; the compiled
   code being interpreted would get destroyed, and on return back to the
   compiled code bad things would happen.
6) Expanding multiple CC variants of the same opcode won't work properly.
   It will only expand the piecewise intersections of the specified addressing
   modes.  Instead, it should go through and do all the intersections, and then
   run through each variant's expansion pattern with "----------------" as the
   expansion pattern for all other variants.
