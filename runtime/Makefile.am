# The way we use labels in our assembler is out of spec.  The gcc info
# pages say that you're not allowed to jump between labels of asm.
# Historically, however, we chose not to put everything into a single
# function and then jump about within spec.  IIRC, that was either due
# to the compilation time and memory consumption to be excessive
# and/or due to us running into compiler bugs.  This was all back
# around 1995 though and we have more memory and better compilers.  As
# such, it may make sense to re-evaluate the decision to split all the
# opcodes into separate functions.  However, until we do that, we need
# to deal with the fact that some dead-code-elimination (DCE)
# optimizations will cause our trickery to fail.  As such, we include
# "-fno-dce" in the architectures where we know we're going to have trouble.

# Syn68k uses inline assembly that confuses various gcc stack optimizations.
# Under gcc 2.x -fno-defer-pop is sufficient to get gcc to do the right thing
# with our code.  Under gcc 3.x we need to also add -maccumulate-outgoing-args.
# Since we don't know what gcc we have until we try to execute CC, we
# do a test right here to figure out if the c-compiler understands
# -maccumulate-outgoing-args.  If it does, we use it.
#
# A better solution would be to put something into our asm to form a
# barrier that gcc won't try to do stack optimizations across.  I haven't yet
# scoured the gcc 3 documentation or source code to see if there's something
# obvious that can be used.
